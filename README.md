# Explanation of the Code
The code is a React application that creates a Pokemon directory. It fetches data from the PokeAPI to retrieve a list of Pokemon and their details. The fetched data is displayed in a list format, and users can search for specific Pokemon, load more Pokemon, and view additional details for each Pokemon. The code is divided into multiple components, including PokemonDirectory, SearchBar, Home, About, and Nav, and it uses React Router for navigation.

# Components 
PokemonDirectory: 
The main component responsible for fetching and displaying the Pokemon data. It uses the useState and useEffect hooks to manage state and perform side effects.
SearchBar: 
A reusable component that renders a search bar and triggers a search callback when the user enters a search term.
Home: 
Renders the home page of the application, displaying a welcome message and an image.
About:
 Renders the about page of the application, providing information about the Pokemon franchise.
Nav: 
Renders the navigation bar of the application, providing links to the home, Pokemon directory, and about pages.
App:
 The root component of the application that sets up the navigation routes and renders the navigation bar and content based on the current route.

 # External Dependencies
 1.react-router-dom
 2.PokeAPI to fetch Pokemon data.

 # Possible improvements
Loading state: Add a loading state to indicate when data is being fetched from the API.
Pagination: Implement pagination instead of just loading more Pokemon when the "Load More" button is clicked.
